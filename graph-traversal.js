Can represent this two ways, a Matrix, or an Adjacency List.
A Matrix takes up more space, but is generally easier to visualize and represent because it is just a 2 dimensional array filled with ones and zeroes.
Here the matrix would have a lot of empty spaces because there are not a lot of airport relative to the possible combinations of paths.
A matrix would also be a lot slower to iterate over.

The recursive nature of this algorithm means that if a node has not been visited,
we call the function again, pushing it to the top of the call stack. Making the algorithm go deeper and deeper into the tree
until we find a match.That means that this function will continue to call itself recursively until all of the airports have been visited,
or until it finds Bangkok.

The DFS way only take three steps, or three function calls to find our route, as opposed to (8) in the previous one. (BFS)
